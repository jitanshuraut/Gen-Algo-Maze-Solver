# Gen-Algo-Maze-Solver

# Project Description:
This project implements a pathfinding algorithm using a genetic algorithm approach in Python. The goal is to find the shortest path from a starting point to an ending point in a binary maze while avoiding obstacles (walls). The project offers a novel approach to solving pathfinding problems by employing genetic algorithms, which evolve a population of candidate solutions over multiple generations to find an optimal or near-optimal solution.

# Features:
### ```Genetic Algorithm Approach:```
Utilizes a genetic algorithm to evolve a population of potential solutions (individuals) over multiple generations to find the shortest path.
### ```Customizable Maze Generation:```
Allows users to generate random binary mazes with guaranteed paths and obstacles.
### ```Path Visualization:```
Provides a visualization of the maze and the path found by the genetic algorithm.
### ```Dynamic Mutation Strategy:```
Implements a custom mutation strategy to ensure diversity in the population and prevent premature convergence.
### ```Efficiency and Scalability:```
Designed to handle large maze sizes efficiently and scale well with increasing problem complexity
